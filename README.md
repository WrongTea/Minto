# Minto: local startup and static CSS

Requires Python 3.12 or newer. From the project directory (PowerShell):

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\python manage.py check
.venv\Scripts\python manage.py collectstatic --noinput
.venv\Scripts\python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000
```

`DEBUG=False` remains enabled. WhiteNoise serves files collected into
`staticfiles/`; edit originals in `static/`, never the collected copies.
After changing CSS, stop your server, run `collectstatic --noinput` again,
restart it and refresh the browser without cache (Ctrl+F5).
For deployment, run collectstatic before starting/restarting your WSGI server.
`runserver` above is for local checks only.

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python manage.py findstatic css/base.css css/404.css --verbosity 2
.venv\Scripts\python manage.py test
```

The custom `404.html` is rendered by Django's default 404 handler, with HTTP
status 404. It uses local CSS and does not require Tailwind.
Ordinary pages retain their existing Tailwind CDN dependency in `base.html`;
their utility classes require access to `https://cdn.tailwindcss.com`.
WhiteNoise configuration follows the [official integration guide](https://whitenoise.readthedocs.io/en/stable/django.html).

## Scope of this checkout and verification

This is a separate diagnostic clone, `Minto-remote-review`, based on GitHub
`main` at `72061e7`. Fetch and pull --ff-only completed before changes.
The original local Minto directory with the reported settings.py/views.py
edits was not found. Those edits could not be compared or integrated;
this checkout must not be used to overwrite them wholesale.

Before the fix, a real isolated WSGI HTTP server returned HTML/404 for
`/static/css/base.css` and for the 404 template's relative CSS requests,
such as `/profile/5235/base.css`. `findstatic` located the source files,
but `collectstatic` failed because STATIC_ROOT was unset.

After the fix, using DEBUG=False, a fresh temporary SQLite database and an
automatically allocated loopback port:

- `/`: HTTP 200; base.css, copy_link.css and videos.css: HTTP 200, text/css.
- `/profile/5235/` and `/__minto_missing_91af6e__/`: custom template, HTTP 404;
  base.css and 404.css: HTTP 200, text/css, CSS bodies rather than error HTML.
- collectstatic: 160 files copied; all 8 tests and manage.py check passed.
- Tailwind CDN: HTTP 200, text/javascript, redirect to version 3.4.17.

No browser connection was available, so Network/Console, computed styles
and visual appearance were not verified. No user database or existing
server process was used. No commit or push was performed.
